This is my First Text file for practice of Git and GitHub.
I created my account on Github.
I installed Git in my Command prompt.
Now I am pushing my Dummy project into Github and then pull the code from my repository.
After that I will check it from other user that how it works.
Thank-you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This file is ready to push again in develop branch by American Development team.
So, now we will perform all the operations now to add the modified changes to out Github repository.

I am checking my develop branch again to test it in GitHub repository.
It works fine for me and now try to merge it with master branch.
