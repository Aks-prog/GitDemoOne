This is my Second Text file for practice of Git and GitHub.
I installed Git in my Command prompt.
I created my account on Github.
Thank-you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


I am updating the code from GitDemoOne user.
And it is ready to pus on my Github reporsitory.
So that, GitX can use download the code and work on it.

I performed Pull command.
This file is now updated by GitX user and add some lines in this file.
Now I am moving this changes to my Github repository.
Before moving, I will perform all the operations of GIT and then I will see the changes in GitHub repository.
